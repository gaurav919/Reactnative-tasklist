# Project 3 - React Native Task List

## Specification
For this project, you are going to build a simple Task List app. Users will be able to open your app and add items to their todo list of things that they want to get done. Each item will have a name, a description, and a way to record whether it has been completed or not. Since we have not yet covered data storage, the app should pre-populate with just a few example items at start up and work as intended while in use, but it does not have to remember the state of the list from run to run.

## Requirements
Your app must meet the following requirements and specifications. Deviating from these will result in a reduced grade. Remember this project is graded on a two (2) point scale. If you don't meet all the requiremets you will only get one (1) point.

You will be doing this app in React Native (JavaScript and JSX). There are a number of React and React Native tutorials, but I've not found one that gets you as far along as there was with iOS or even Android. Your Java programming will help you quite a bit, but keep in mind that JavaScript is not Java and React has a different paradigm than iOS and Android do.

The app shall be made up of three total screens:

* a task list screen
* a create new task screen (or modal overlay)
* a task details screen (could be the same as the new task screen, could also be a modal overlay)

More detailed information about each screen is found below.

To accomplish this, you will (most likely) have some set of the following classes/components in your project:

* `TaskList` - The "main" view for the app, uses ListView or FlatList. Either is acceptable.
* `TaskListItem` - the component that contains each row of the TaskList. The class that handles how a `Task` appears on a list.
* `TaskDetail` - a view that shows the details of a task for adding or editing. This may be a modal overlay or an separate screen, your choice.
* `Task` - the model representing a single task. This may also be just a plain JavaScript object.

### TaskList, TaskListItem, and Task

A very large portion of your overall code base will go into these three files/components. There are a few tutorials on how to do this. You should read through several to get a feel for how React and React Native work. There are also tasklist-like tutorials that may also be helpful to you.

* When the app starts a list of tasks should appear with checkboxes next to them
	* Use a ListView or FlatList (better) to display items from the task list
* Tapping on the checkbox should mark the item as complete or not complete as appropriate
* Clicking on an item should bring up an edit task screen or modal view.
* There should be a `+` floating action or similar button to add a new item to the list. You could have the '+' be in the navigation header but it's a bit tricky to do that.

### Task

* Has all the fieds for a task item (name, completed, due date, notes)

### Add Item / Edit Item Activity

The add and/or edit item should be either a separate screen (using some form of navigation) or a modal overlay. It is launched from the `TaskList` by clicking on an item or the create new item button. The Add/Edit process should have the same look and feel as your `TaskList` does.

* Must have an `X`, back arrow, or cancel somewhere which cancels the current operation.
* Must have `Save` option which will save changes to a current task or the details of a new task and return to the main TaskList with the list updated.
* Must have fields for all the `Task` members (name, due date, completed, notes)
* Make sure that any numeric fields are numeric entry.
* Added or edited items should appear in the list upon save and the order fixed if needed.

## Submission Notes
When we work with GitHub this semester, I will take the state of your repos at the start of class on the due date and use that for grading. There is nothing you need to do specifically in GitHub.

* You **must NOT** include a build for Android (it's doesn't work anyway) in your repository. 
* You must create a `README.md` file that describes your project and:
	* Project/App Title
	* Basic instructions on usage
	* Any special info we need to run the app
	* Lessons learned (at least one paragraph)
	* You *may* write your report in Markdown format, that would be nice.

## Definitions
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Best Practice Document RFC 2119 Key Words for use in Request For Comments (RFC) to Indicate Requirement Levels defines several keywords that are used in this assignment and throughout the course. Pay special attention to where they appear in the assignment.

Some of the keywords used in this assignment are as follows;

**MUST**: This word, or the terms **REQUIRED** or **SHALL**, mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.

**SHOULD**: This word, or the adjective **RECOMMENDED**, mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be under.

**MAY**: This word, or the adjective **OPTIONAL**, mean that an item is truly optional. One vendor may choose to include the item because a particular marketplace requires it or because the vendor feels that it enhances the product while another vendor may omit the same item.

Much of this project is adapted from a similar course, [CS 4720 Mobile Application Development](https://cs4720.cs.virginia.edu/category/android) at University of Virginia. Thank you to UVA for the heavy lifting. Green is my pepper.
