My Project name is todo.
Project/App Title:
-> My Project name is todo.
Basic instructions on usage:
-> We can add a new todo item by clicking on the (+) icon on the right top corner. In the detail Screen you can add the todo title, pick a date and a extra note and can save the todo. Similarly, you can click on each todo item to edit the todoitem.
There is a check box where you can mark as complete. There is a delete button where you can delete the item.
The items are recorded in the list view and are sorted in date.
Any special info we need to run the app:
-> React native is updating its version so keep an eye on that . My Code can be outdated but it works.
Lessons learned (at least one paragraph)
-> I find react native  much more easier than android studio (kotlin) and xcode(swift).
